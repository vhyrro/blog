Enjoy mind-bending theoretical challenges? Or perhaps you're interested in note taking,
organization and how it shapes our lives? You're in the right place.

I'm Vhyrro, lead developer of [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg), a modern
attempt at creating a truly comprehensive organizational suite for Neovim and (soon) beyond.

In this blog I explore the foundations of what make note taking tools effective,
interesting bits and bobs about human nature and how we perceive new information
as well as tonnes of technical challenges I encountered when implementing Neorg and its
ecosystem!

Take a wander around the digital garden, and I hope you enjoy your stay :)
